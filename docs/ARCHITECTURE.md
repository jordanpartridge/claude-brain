# Mindbank Architecture

## Core Concepts

### Entity-Observation Pattern
The system is built around two primary concepts:

1. **Entities**
   - Represent any distinct concept, technology, project, or piece of knowledge
   - Can have rich metadata
   - Support multiple types (project, concept, technology, etc.)
   - Can be linked through relationships

2. **Observations**
   - Represent discrete pieces of knowledge about entities
   - Include confidence scores
   - Track source and timestamp
   - Support rich text content

### Relationships
- Bidirectional relationships between entities
- Typed relationships (implements, depends_on, relates_to, etc.)
- Support for relationship metadata
- Automatic inverse relationship management

## Data Model

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Entity ||--o{ Observation : has
    Entity ||--o{ Relationship : from
    Entity ||--o{ Relationship : to
    RelationshipType ||--o{ Relationship : defines
    
    Entity {
        string name
        string type
        json metadata
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at
    }
    
    Observation {
        text content
        float confidence
        string source
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at
    }
    
    Relationship {
        int from_entity_id
        int to_entity_id
        string type
        json metadata
        int inverse_of
    }
    
    RelationshipType {
        string name
        string inverse_name
        boolean is_bidirectional
        json validation_rules
    }
```

## Service Layer

### Knowledge Management
- `EntityManager`: Handles entity CRUD and metadata validation
- `ObservationManager`: Manages knowledge observations and confidence scores
- `RelationshipManager`: Handles entity relationships and graph traversal

### Search & Retrieval
- Full-text search across entities and observations
- Metadata-aware filtering
- Graph traversal capabilities
- Future: Vector search for semantic similarity

### Interface Layer
1. **CLI Tools**
   - Knowledge population
   - Observation recording
   - Relationship management
   - Knowledge querying

2. **Web Interface (Filament)**
   - Entity management
   - Knowledge graph visualization
   - Search interface
   - Metadata editor

## Implementation Details

### Command Pattern
The system uses Laravel's command pattern for knowledge operations:
```php
class ObserveCommand extends Command
{
    protected $signature = 'knowledge:observe {entity} {--type=} {--metadata=}'
    
    public function handle()
    {
        // Create/update entity with observation
    }
}
```

### Event System
Events for knowledge operations:
- EntityCreated/Updated
- ObservationAdded
- RelationshipEstablished

### Validation
- Schema-based metadata validation
- Relationship type validation
- Entity type constraints

## Future Enhancements

1. **Vector Search**
   - Embedding generation for entities/observations
   - Semantic similarity search
   - Integration with vector databases

2. **Real-time Updates**
   - WebSocket integration
   - Live knowledge graph updates
   - Collaborative editing

3. **Version Control**
   - Entity/observation versioning
   - Change tracking
   - Rollback capabilities

4. **AI Integration**
   - Automated relationship suggestion
   - Knowledge extraction
   - Smart summarization
