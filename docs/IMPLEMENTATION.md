# Claude Brain Implementation Documentation

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation process for the knowledge graph system that will enable Claude to store and manage learned information about users and interactions.

## Design Philosophy
The system follows these key principles:
1. **Flexibility**: The schema should be adaptable to different types of entities and relationships
2. **Efficiency**: Queries should be optimized for quick retrieval of context
3. **Maintainability**: Code should be well-documented and follow Laravel best practices
4. **Testability**: All components should be thoroughly tested

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Core Database Structure
1. Create migrations for:
   - Entities table (base table for all stored items)
   - Relationships table (connections between entities)
   - Observations table (facts/properties about entities)
   - Interactions table (conversation history)

2. Design considerations:
   - Using polymorphic relationships for flexibility
   - JSON columns for metadata
   - Proper indexing for performance
   - Soft deletes for data preservation

### Phase 2: Model Layer
1. Create base models with relationships:
   - Entity model (core model)
   - Relationship model
   - Observation model
   - Interaction model

2. Add key functionality:
   - Relationship management methods
   - Observation tracking
   - Context retrieval helpers
   - Query scopes for common operations

### Phase 3: GraphQL API
1. Define schema for:
   - Entity queries and mutations
   - Relationship management
   - Observation tracking
   - Interaction history

2. Implement resolvers for:
   - Entity CRUD operations
   - Relationship management
   - Context retrieval
   - Real-time subscriptions

### Phase 4: Testing
1. Unit tests for:
   - Model methods
   - Query scopes
   - Helper functions

2. Feature tests for:
   - GraphQL endpoints
   - Complex operations
   - Edge cases

## Developer Notes
This section will track important decisions and their rationales as we implement each component.
